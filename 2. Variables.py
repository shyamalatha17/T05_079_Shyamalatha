VARIABLES ::
         A Python variable is a symbolic name that is a reference or pointer to an object.
Once an object is assigned to a variable, you can refer to the object by that name.
But the data itself is still contained within the object.

** In simple terms we say like Variables are containers for storing data values.

==>>Creating Variables:
    ->a = 20
    ->Python will go to the address of "a" variable,
    ->It will take the binary value from that address and converts to decimal format
    ->Returns value to console
    ->We are assigning the value 20 to variable 'a'
    ->Variable is a name which is used to refer memory location of assigned value.
    ->A variable name should not start with a number.
***Note - Variable name should not be a keyword like (print, if, else, def, for etc..)
