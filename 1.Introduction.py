Python Introduction ::
       Python is a simple, high level, general purpose, very popular and widely used programming language.
** It is widely used in web Development, software Development, and machine learning Applications.
** It was created by Gudio van Rossum in 1911 and futher developed by Python software Foundation.
** It was mainly designed with an emphasis on code Readability and its syntax allows programmers to express
   their concepts in fewer lines of code.
** It lets you work quickly and integrate systems more efficiently.

==>> Majorily there are 2 versions in python ::
      ** python 2.x(2.7)
      ** python 3.x(3.10.6) latest version.(aug 6)

Where Python can be used??

** python can be used on server to create Web Applications.
** Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.
** Python can connect to Database systems. It can also read and modify files.
** Python can be used to handle Big Data and perform Complex Mathematics.
** Python can be used for rapid prototyping or for production ready software Development.
** and it is used in Developing 3D gaming applications.

Why we use Python ??

** It works on Different Platforms/OS  like Windows, Mac, Linux etc..,
** It has a simple syntax similar to English Language and it allows developers to write programs with fewer lines
   than some other programming Languages.
** Python runs on an interpreter system, it means that the code can be executed as soons as if it is written:
** And it is dynamically typed in which it means there is no need to define the type of the variable.

Advantages of Python::

** It is a high-level programming language (Easy to read, learn and write).
** It is Object-Oriented.
** It is Dynamically Typed.
** Interpreted language.
** It is free and open source.
** It has vast librabries support.
** portability.
** Ease of Use.

Disadvantages::

** Slow speed.
** Not memory Efficient.
** Weak in Mobile Development.Python Introduction ::
